Antcolony - What I learned

I was exploring a few new ideas for me in JavaScript. Firstly, was the idea of a <em> constructor function </em>. In order to create many instances of "Ant", I needed a constructor function which would create an ant as many times as you called the function. In order to use the constructor function, I needed to understand object prototypes, and the prototype property. This is a very clever tool in JavaScript which allows any object to have a 'prototype object'. The object then inherits any properties from the prototype object, in this case, the position, velocity and acceleration of the ants. Becuase the prototype object has randomness built into all of these properties, it means that although the properties are inherited, each time an ant is created (or moves), it inherits a new randomly generated value for these properties. 
<em>Vectors</em> play a big role in this application, to define the location, velocity and acceleration of the ants. It was very pleasing to  
Secondly, <em> randomness. </em> These ants clearly  aren't moving purely randomly. They are tending towards the leaderAnt, and the leaderAnt is tending towards the edges of the screen as you command. I used a randomly generated number in a range, and then change that range depending on, in the case of the leaderAnt buttons pressed, and in the case of the other ants, their direction vector to the leaderAnt.
